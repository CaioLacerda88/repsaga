# Work In Progress

Active branch work. Each section is removed once the branch is merged. Empty
when no in-flight work exists — backlog and parked items live in
`docs/PROJECT.md` → `## §2 Active Backlog` (single source of truth).

When starting a new task, follow CLAUDE.md → "WIP Tracking": write a checklist
here referencing the relevant `docs/PROJECT.md` phase or backlog entry, check
items off as work lands, and remove the section after the merge condenses
the phase summary in PROJECT.md §4.

## Fill Remaining UX — Option C (First-Complete Trigger)

**Branch:** `fix/fill-remaining-out-of-order`
**Reference:** Per PROJECT.md §2 backlog / WIP "Queued" item 2 / locked design
`docs/fill-remaining-gating-mockup-v1.html` §3 "Implementation Notes (Option C)".

**The bug:** `_hasFillableSets` only returns true when an incomplete set has
`setNumber > lastCompletedNumber` (directional). Completing ONLY the last set
hides "Fill Remaining". Breaks mid-session restart, failed-set-1, and
out-of-order logging.

**"Most recent completed set" decision:** Keep the EXISTING selection intent —
the most recent completed set = highest `setNumber` among completed sets. The
old code already selected by `s.setNumber > lastCompleted.setNumber`. Only the
*target filter* changes (drop the directional constraint on which sets get
filled); the *source value* selection stays "highest-setNumber completed".

### Checklist

- [x] Branch created from main
- [x] WIP section written (this)
- [x] Grep all usages of `fillRemaining` / `fillRemainingSets` /
      `_hasFillableSets` / `filledRemainingSets` across lib + test
- [x] `_hasFillableSets` (exercise_card.dart): `any(isCompleted) && any(!isCompleted)`
- [x] `fillRemainingSets` (active_workout_notifier.dart): fill ALL `!isCompleted`
      from highest-setNumber completed set's weight+reps
- [x] Button label → `l10n.fillRemainingSetsCount(count)` ("Preencher restantes (2 séries)")
- [x] New parameterized ARB key (en + pt)
- [x] `fillRemainingSetsSemantics` ARB string updated (en + pt)
- [x] `make gen` regen l10n
- [x] Notifier tests: last-only / first-only / middle-only expanded contract
- [x] Widget tests: button visible out-of-order last-set-only; label count text
- [x] `dart format .` + `dart analyze` (0 issues) + `flutter test` touched files
- [x] Commit on branch (no push / no PR)

### Files to modify

- `lib/features/workouts/ui/widgets/exercise_card.dart` (predicate + label + count arg)
- `lib/features/workouts/providers/notifiers/active_workout_notifier.dart` (filter)
- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` + `lib/l10n/app_pt.arb` (new key + semantics edit)

## Session checkpoint — 2026-06-08 (pre-compact handoff)

**Main HEAD:** `52bf93e3` (post Phase 34 closeout #313).

**Nothing in-flight.** No agents running, no open PRs, no pending CI. This
checkpoint exists so next session can pick the right next-task without
re-deriving state.

### What shipped this wave (Phase 34 — see PROJECT.md §4 for full detail)

15 PRs across 4 days closed three workstreams:
- **Auth remediation:** #298 #299 #300 #301 #302 #303 #304 #312 — culminated in
  the typed DB-42501 → session-expired snackbar + Sign-in CTA recovery + the
  provider-init-timing footgun fix in `ProfileNotifier` (saveOnboardingProfile
  + updateTrainingFrequency + toggleWeightUnit now read from
  `authStateProvider.value?.session?.user.id`).
- **Legal compliance:** #305 (Privacy Policy + ToS LGPD/GDPR/medical rewrite)
  + #308 (JSON portability export from Manage Data) + #309 (4 consent UI
  surfaces: signup age gate, bodyweight + gender explicit opt-in, analytics
  opt-out) + #310 (Launch Phase compliance follow-up backlog).
- **UX + bug polish:** #306 (home ActionHero reactivity), #307 (manage-data
  avatar storage leak + exercises CASCADE + reset-all active workouts),
  #311 (signup + Fill Remaining UX mockups — implementations queued).

**Hosted Supabase ops applied:** migration 00073 (locale metadata backfill —
6 users) + migration 00074 (exercises CASCADE) + `delete-user` Edge Function
redeployed with avatar storage removal.

**APK on phone:** SM S938B at HEAD `43c83d07` (= #312 merge before #313
docs-only closeout — production code is up to date). Cumulative #298-#312
installed.

### Queued — your call to dispatch

These have shipped mockups (#311 merged) but no implementation has been
dispatched. Pick when ready.

1. **Signup screen redesign — Option A.** `docs/signup-screen-mockup-v1.html`
   on main is the locked design target. Scope: single-screen form, add
   confirm-password + display_name field (move display_name out of
   onboarding so onboarding only collects fitness signals), add 3-segment
   non-blocking password-strength bar, inline Privacy + Terms links into the
   age-gate checkbox label (drop the separate chip row PR #309 added),
   "CRIAR CONTA" heading in Rajdhani 700. Preserve PR #309's structural
   CTA-disabled-until-checkbox-ticked guarantee (`onPressed = null`). 412dp
   device must not require scrolling.
2. **Fill Remaining UX — Option C.** `docs/fill-remaining-gating-mockup-v1.html`
   on main. Two-method change in `lib/features/workouts/ui/widgets/exercise_card.dart`:
   - `_hasFillableSets` predicate → "any completed AND any incomplete"
     (today's directional check is the bug — only fires when an incomplete
     set's `setNumber > lastCompleted.setNumber`)
   - `fillRemainingSets` → fill all incomplete regardless of `setNumber`
     ordering
   No new UI state. User's grey-out proposal (Option B) was rejected because
   it breaks valid mid-session flows (failed set 1 + completed sets 2-3,
   restart mid-session).

Both can ship in parallel — they touch different files. Either is a small
PR (one screen + tests).

### External / manual items — user side (don't dispatch agents)

From PR #310 Launch Phase compliance follow-ups (also in PROJECT.md §3
Launch Phase prereqs):
- **`dpo@repsaga.app` alias** — required for PR #305 §12 DPO promise to
  honor any LGPD Art. 41 request. Blocked on `repsaga.app` domain
  registration.
- **LGPD Art. 7 IX legitimate-interest balancing memo** — one-page internal
  doc. PR #305 §4a's "balancing test documented and available on request"
  becomes a real commitment when ANPD asks. Store wherever you keep
  internal compliance docs.
- **Domain registration** — `repsaga.com` / `.app` / `.com.br`. Unblocks
  DPO alias + Supabase Site URL fix + assetlinks.json hosting.
- **Supabase Dashboard → Site URL** — currently default `http://localhost:3000`.
  Set to any HTTPS string (e.g. `https://repsaga.app` even before
  registration) as the immediate workaround — `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
  redirect then reads as "site can't be reached" rather than
  "localhost: connection refused". Proper fix (Android App Links +
  intent-filter + assetlinks.json + Dart handler) is Launch Phase scope
  per PR #304.
- **Supabase backup retention** — verify Dashboard → Project Settings →
  Database PITR window matches PR #305 §7's "30 days" claim. Free tier =
  7 days; if longer, hedge the policy text in a tiny follow-up PR.

### Open verification pending — user testing

The fresh-signup save bug (DB-42501) recurred 5 times across this wave. PR #312
ships defensive UX (snackbar + Sign-in CTA recovery) AND a fresh-signup E2E
regression that drives the actual app signup form with an ephemeral user.
CI green at 37m41s with that test passing.

**Worth eyeballing on the S938B (already installed):**
1. Sign up with a fresh email+password account → onboarding → save profile.
   If you hit "Couldn't save your profile" → bug is still alive (defense-in-depth
   should have surfaced "Your session expired. Sign in again." + Sign-in CTA
   instead — if you see THAT, defense works but server-side race still fires).
2. Test Manage Data → "Export my data" (#308 ships the JSON export).
3. Test Profile → Settings → PRIVACY toggles (#309) — `Send crash reports`
   already existed, plus new `Send usage analytics` and `Body weight consent`.
4. Test gender editor (Profile Settings) — first open should show the
   disclosure banner, picking any value (including "Not set") should
   extinguish it permanently.

### Recovery instructions (if next session needs to pick up)

1. Read this checkpoint block first.
2. Read `docs/PROJECT.md` §0 Quick Reference (Phase 34 COMPLETE, next is
   Launch Phase) + the Phase 34 §4 entry for the full ship list.
3. `gh pr list --state open` should return empty.
4. Task list in this session: #48 (signup UX) + #51 (Fill Remaining UX) are
   in_progress with the mockup PRs merged but implementation dispatches not
   started. #49 + #50 completed. The next session can re-derive these from
   PROJECT.md if the task list resets.
5. **Lingering disk junk** that doesn't matter:
   `.claude/worktrees/agent-a32a6dd8f4eaa72f4/` exists as an empty
   directory whose inode is held by a Windows background process
   (Search Indexer, Defender, or the IDE file watcher). Will release on
   next IDE/system restart. No git impact — `git worktree list` shows
   only main.

### What's NOT in this checkpoint

Anything mid-implementation. All agents that ran this wave finished cleanly +
had their PRs merged. There are no half-built branches, no uncommitted
changes, no agents to resume via SendMessage. Hard reset is safe.
