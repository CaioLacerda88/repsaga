      // Releasing inside an outer postFrameCallback ensures the flag stays
      // `true` throughout frame N+1's postFrame phase, then is released at
      // the end of frame N+2 when the active-workout screen has already
      // unmounted (route changed). The early release at the top of this
      // method (before navigateAfterFinish) and the redundant release in
      // the `finally` block were both removed — the deferred release is
      // the single owner of the lifecycle. The `finally` only resets
      // `_isFinishing`. `_isFinishHandled` is NOT reset in `finally` —
      // on exception paths (e.g. `navigateAfterFinish` throws synchronously,
      // which it shouldn't in production) the flag stays `true` for the
      // screen's lifetime. That's harmless because `_isFinishing` is
      // cleared and the next retry call re-arms the flag normally at
      // line 146.
      //
      // The secondary safety net for late rebuilds is `context.mounted` at
      // the call site in `active_workout_screen.dart:75`: once the route
      // has changed, the screen's context is no longer mounted and any
      // late postFrameCallback (e.g. one Riverpod schedules after the
      // deferred release fires) returns immediately without calling
      // `context.go('/home')`.

      // doing so would re-open the AW-EX-D-US1-02 race. If navigateAfterFinish
      // somehow throws synchronously (it never does in the production code
      // — it just registers a callback), the deferred release never fires
      // and the flag stays `true` for the rest of the screen's lifetime —
      // which is harmless because `_isFinishing` is also still cleared
      // here, allowing a subsequent finish to fire and re-set both flags.
